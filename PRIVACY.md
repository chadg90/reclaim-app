# Privacy Policy – Reclaim: UK Train Delay

**Last updated:** February 2026

This privacy policy applies to the app **Reclaim: UK Train Delay** (“the App”) on iOS. It explains how we handle information when you use the App.

---

## Who we are

The App is provided for use in the United Kingdom to help you estimate train delay refunds under Delay Repay and to access official operator claim portals. References to “we”, “us” or “our” in this policy mean the developer(s) of the App.

---

## Information we do not collect

- We do **not** require you to create an account or sign in.
- We do **not** collect your name, email address, or other personal data for our own servers.
- We do **not** send your journey details (train company, ticket price, delay time) to any server we control. Those details are used only on your device to calculate an estimate and to open the operator’s claim portal.

---

## Information stored on your device

The App stores the following **only on your device** (we do not receive this data):

- **Pro purchase status** – Whether you have unlocked the paid “Pro” feature, so the App can show or hide features accordingly.
- **Free use count** – A count of how many free claim flows you have used (up to a limit), so we can apply the free-use limit. This is not linked to your identity.

This information is stored using your device’s local storage (e.g. UserDefaults) and is not transmitted to us.

---

## In-app purchases (Apple)

If you buy the “Pro” upgrade, the purchase is processed by **Apple** (App Store / StoreKit). We do not see or store your payment details. Apple’s privacy policy and terms apply to those transactions: [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

We only receive from Apple the fact that your account has the Pro entitlement, so the App can unlock Pro features on your device.

---

## Third-party links

The App includes links to **train operators’ official claim portals** (e.g. Delay Repay websites). When you tap “Go to Official Claim Portal”, you leave the App and open the operator’s website in a browser. That operator’s own privacy policy and terms apply to anything you do on their site. We do not control those sites or their data practices.

---

## Children

The App is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will address it.

---

## Changes to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy. For significant changes, we may notify you in the App or via the App Store product page where possible.

---

## Your rights (UK / EEA)

If you are in the UK or the European Economic Area, you have rights under applicable data protection law (e.g. UK GDPR), including the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Because we do not collect or hold your personal data on our systems (only locally on your device), you can:

- **Delete data stored by the App** by deleting the App from your device.
- **Reset or manage purchase status** via your Apple ID and App Store subscription/ purchase settings.

If you have questions about your data or this policy, please contact us (see below).
